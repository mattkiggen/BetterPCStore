# BetterPCStore

Simple web api built with ASP.net Core and Entity Framework Core to test out Auth0 authentication and authorization.

If you would like to test out the project you will need to change the API keys within the appsettings.json file, as the keys no longer work and were just for testing purposes.

Ideally, your API keys should be stored in your env.
